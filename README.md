# whatwhichwear

### What?

_Whatwhichwear_ is an application to keep track of your wardrobe, help you pack for vacations, and get rid of clothes you don't wear frequently.

### Why?
About a year ago, as my mom was packing for a business trip, I happened upon her packing list. Instead of writing a one-dimensional list, she had written a grid of compatible tops and bottoms. This enabled her to knock down her packing time to about 10 minutes, while also saving space in her suitcase.

### How?
_Whatwhichwear_ is built with a React / Express stack.

__v1__ is a local app that lets you:
1. add articles of clothing to an outfit.
1. keep track of how often you wear each outfit and article of clothing.
1. remove clothing from your wardrobe that you don't wear often.

### What's Next?
- adding photos
- create packing list based on trip parameters
- user authentication
